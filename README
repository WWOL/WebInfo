WebInfo project by Brian McCarthy (WWOL)

This program runs as a server and binds to port 21000.
To test it point your browser to 127.0.0.1:21000 on the same machine as the server is running.
Use the arguments info=<type> to get info.
For example:
127.0.0.1:21000?info=cpu&info=ram
This will show information about the cpu (number of cores) and the ram (total, free  etc).

Have fun.
